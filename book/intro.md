Intro Prep for JS:

*(mochi)..API- describes the scheme and format that a programmer can use to securely access resources.

Compiler + Interpreter + API = Runtime environment. 

Compilers produce an output file that the computer can run directly. 

Interpreters do not produces binary that computer can run directly instead, interpreter runs code. 

Two main runtime environments for JS- Browser and Node JS



Types of methods; 

instance methods- `Constructor.prototype.methodName()`  (instance methods include `.prototype`)

- instance methods are applied to a value of the type the constructor represents. 
- we can apply an instance method ot the string `'hello'`. 
```js
'hello,'.concat('Bob!')
  // 'Hello, Bob!'
```



static methods- `Constructor.methodName()` (like class methods in Ruby)
